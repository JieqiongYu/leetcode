/**
 * [LeetCode][760]Find Anagram Mappings
 * 
 * Given two lists Aand B, and B is an anagram of A. 
 * B is an anagram of A means B is made by randomizing the order of 
 * the elements in A.
 * 
 * We want to find an index mapping P, from A to B. A mapping P[i] = j means 
 * the ith element in A appears in B at index j.
 * 
 * These lists A and B may contain duplicates. If there are multiple answers, 
 * output any of them.
 * 
 * For example, given
 * A = [12, 28, 46, 32, 50]
 * B = [50, 12, 32, 46, 28]
 * We should return
 * [1, 4, 3, 2, 0]
 * as P[0] = 1 because the 0th element of A appears at B[1], 
 * and P[1] = 4 because the 1st element of A appears at B[4], and so on.
 * 
 * Note:
 * A, B have equal lengths in range [1, 100].
 * A[i], B[i] are integers in range [0, 10^5].

/**
 * Solution    
 * 
 * Intuition
 * Take the example A = [12, 28, 46], B = [46, 12, 28]. 
 * We want to know where the 12 occurs in B, 
 * say at position 1; then where the 28 occurs in B, 
 * which is position 2; then where the 46 occurs in B, which is position 0.
 * If we had a dictionary (hash table) D = {46: 0, 12: 1, 28: 2}, 
 * then this question could be handled easily.
 * 
 * Algorithm
 * Create the hash table D as described above. 
 * Then, the answer is a list of D[A[i]] for i = 0, 1, â€¦.
